# Project: RoyalRoad visualization

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to mine a site called royalroad.
https://www.royalroad.com/home

And to gain a understanding of how different authors, fictions, comments, and reviews interact. Will get the data and store it in a understandable and searchable graph format.

A secondary goal of this project is to learn ai assisted coding, scrapy, neo4j graph database, and python.

## Core functionality
- Scrape royalroad with scrapy and store authors, fictions, comments, and reviews inside a graph database in a readable and understandable way.


## Key Constraints
 - Polite scraping. Royalroad is an external site and this project should limit how many requests for data are sent.
    - Rate limited crawling
    - Follow royalroad robots.txt
 - Big data. There can be a lot of data present. Be aware of size of data being stored and proceed with caution.
 - Learning. This is a personal project - developer needs to understand the code.

## Implementation requirements
 - **Error handling**: Log errors for now (network failures, parsing errors, missing data). Use Scrapy's logging module.
 - **Data validation**: Validate all scraped data before inserting into Neo4j database. Check for missing fields, verify data types, and ensure data conforms to expected formats.

## Success criteria
 - Data is politely retrieved from RoyalRoad and stored in a readable way.
 - Developer learns about python, ai assisted development, cursor, scraping, and neor4j graph database.
